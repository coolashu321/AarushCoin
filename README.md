# AarushCoin
My take on developing a new cryptocurrency!

What is AarushCoin?
----------------

AarushCoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. AarushCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. Branches are created regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of AarushCoin.

The contributers are mentioned on this repository.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. However, as a preliminary check, I have included [CoinTest.py](CoinTest.py)

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
